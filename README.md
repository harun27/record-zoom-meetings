# record-zoom-meetings
 Record Zoom Meetings automatically with OBS and Chrome.

## How to use
- Download this repository
- Enter the times of your meetings in the file `Times.csv` in the section *From* and *To* with any texteditor or programs like libreoffice and excel. 
- Enter the URLs of your meetings in the section *URL*.
- If you haven't installed Python, you can do it from the store (i.e. Python 3.7) or manually from the internet.
- Double click on `start.py`

## Tips
- You have to install chrome and accept that chrome can automatically open zoom-meetings. This can be done by opening a meeting and accepting the pop-up.
- It is preferred that the recording format in obs is .mkv
- In the zoom-settings you have to activate that you directly join to the audio of the meeting and preferably go into fullscreen mode.
- This tiny script is for now only programed for windows and chrome.
- It is not possible to record meetings that are in the same time.

Please consider that it is not allowed to record people and publish it without there permission.
